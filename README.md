# Terraform AWS GRC-Compliant Storage Bucket

This Terraform module provisions an AWS S3 storage bucket engineered to meet rigorous Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) standards. It enforces specific **NIST SP 800-53** security controls and automatically generates JSON compliance evidence for auditing.

## Enforced NIST SP 800-53 Controls

* **SC-28 (Protection of Information at Rest):** Enforces mandatory server-side encryption configuration across storage buckets.
* **AC-3 (Access Enforcement):** Blocks all public access via strict S3 Public Access Block configurations.
* **CM-6 (Configuration Settings):** Enforces bucket versioning and standardized resource tagging to maintain configuration baselines.
* **AU-3 (Content of Audit Records):** Configures dedicated access logging and audit trails.

## Repository Structure

* `main.tf`: Core resource definitions, encryption, access controls, and logging configurations.
* `variables.tf`: Input variables for customization.
* `outputs.tf`: Module outputs including encryption details.
* `verify.sh`: Post-apply validation script for control verification.
* `evidence/`: Contains JSON proof artifacts generated from Terraform execution plans.
* `policies/`: Rego policies and unit tests that enforce SC-28, AC-3 and CM-6 against the Terraform plan.
* `.github/workflows/grc-gate.yml`: CI policy gate that runs the policies on every pull request to `main`.
* `verify-evidence.sh`: Verifies a signed evidence bundle's integrity, authenticity and timeliness. Prints `CHAIN INTACT` only if every check passes.

## Usage

1. Initialize the Terraform environment:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

## Policy-as-Code Controls

Rego policies (Open Policy Agent) read the Terraform plan and deny any plan that violates a control.

| Control | Policy | Denies |
|---|---|---|
| **SC-28** Protection of Information at Rest | `policies/sc28_encryption_aws.rego` | Any bucket with no matching encryption configuration |
| **AC-3** Access Enforcement | `policies/ac3_no_public_aws.rego` | Any bucket whose public access block is missing or has any of its four flags not set to `true` |
| **CM-6** Configuration Settings | `policies/cm6_required_tags_aws.rego` | Any taggable resource missing one of the four required tags |

### Design Note: Match by Reference

At plan time the bucket name is unknown, because its random suffix isn't generated until apply. So the
policies can't match an encryption configuration or public access block to its bucket by name.
Instead they match by reference: the plan JSON records that the encryption resource's `bucket`
argument points at `aws_s3_bucket.primary.id`, and the policy compares that reference to the bucket's
address.

## CI Policy Gate

Every pull request to `main` runs `.github/workflows/grc-gate.yml`. Nobody reviews a change for
encryption, public access or tagging by hand: the pipeline does it in seconds.

**What the gate does:**

1. Installs Conftest at a pinned version (`0.62.0`).
2. Generates the Terraform plan from the branch's code, then runs the SC-28, AC-3 and CM-6 policies against it.
3. Fails the job if any policy reports a violation (fail closed).
4. Uploads the results (`evidence/conftest-results.json`) as a build artifact on every run, pass or fail.

**What happens when a control breaks:** the matching policy fails, the `grc-gate` check goes red,
and branch protection on `main` requires that check to pass, so the pull request cannot be merged
by anyone until the violation is fixed. The failure message names the resource and the remediation,
and the evidence artifact keeps a record of the failure.

| Pull request | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|
| [#1](https://github.com/m00t/grc-terraform-aws-bucket/pull/1) | Compliant plan | ✅ `grc-gate` passed, merged |
| [#2](https://github.com/m00t/grc-terraform-aws-bucket/pull/2) | Plan with the primary bucket's encryption removed | ❌ SC-28 failed, merge blocked |

Example failure from #2:

```
SC-28: aws_s3_bucket.primary has no server-side encryption configuration.
Remediation: add an aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration with bucket = aws_s3_bucket.primary.id.
```

## Keyless CI: Generating the Plan with GitHub OIDC

The gate generates the Terraform plan itself on every pull request, from the code in the branch,
instead of trusting a committed `plan.json`. To do that, CI needs to read AWS, and it does so
without any stored credentials.

**How it works:** GitHub issues the workflow a short-lived, signed OIDC token that identifies the
exact repository and event. AWS trusts GitHub as an identity provider and exchanges that token for
temporary credentials on a read-only IAM role (`ReadOnlyAccess`). The credentials expire on their
own within the hour. The role's trust policy accepts tokens only from this repository, matched on
GitHub's immutable account and repository IDs, so a renamed or recreated repository with the same
name cannot assume it.

**Why keyless beats stored credentials:** a stored access key is a long-lived secret. It can leak
through logs, forks or a compromised CI system, it works from anywhere until someone notices and
revokes it, and it has to be rotated by hand. With OIDC there is no secret to steal. Every session
is minted on demand, scoped to one repository, limited to read-only access, and expires
automatically. Each login is also recorded in AWS CloudTrail as a web-identity session tied to the
repository and event, which gives auditors a clear trail of who accessed the account and why.

| Pull request | Change | Result |
|---|---|---|
| [#4](https://github.com/m00t/grc-terraform-aws-bucket/pull/4) | Generate the plan in CI via OIDC | ✅ Plan generated from `main.tf`, all policies passed |
| [#5](https://github.com/m00t/grc-terraform-aws-bucket/pull/5) | Primary bucket encryption removed from `main.tf` | ❌ SC-28 failed, merge blocked |

**Lesson learned:** the first OIDC attempt was denied (`Not authorized to perform
sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`). The CloudTrail record of the failed login showed that GitHub's
token subject includes immutable IDs (`repo:OWNER@ID/REPO@ID:pull_request`), not the
`repo:OWNER/REPO:*` format the trust policy expected. Updating the trust policy to that format
fixed it, and it binds the role more tightly than a name-based match.

## Evidence Chain of Custody

Every gate run, pass or fail, packages its evidence (the CI-generated `plan.json` and the policy
results) into `evidence.tar.gz` and signs it with Cosign keyless signing. The signing identity is the
workflow run itself: GitHub's OIDC token proves it is `grc-gate.yml` in this repository, Sigstore
issues a short-lived certificate bound to that identity, and the signature is recorded in Sigstore's
public transparency log (Rekor). There is no private key to store, rotate or leak. The pass/fail
decision runs as the last step, so a failed run is signed and preserved too.

| Custody property | Question | Artifact that proves it |
|---|---|---|
| **Integrity** | Has it changed? | `evidence.tar.gz.sha256`: SHA-256 of the bundle, recomputed by `verify-evidence.sh` |
| **Authenticity** | Who produced it? | `evidence.sig.bundle`: signature plus Sigstore certificate naming `m00t/grc-terraform-aws-bucket/.github/workflows/grc-gate.yml` as the signer |
| **Timeliness** | When was it produced? | `evidence.sig.bundle`: Rekor transparency-log entry with a signed timestamp |
| **Preservation** | Can it still be retrieved unaltered? | Not yet implemented (planned: S3 Object Lock vault) |

`verify-evidence.sh` pins the OIDC issuer to GitHub Actions and the certificate identity to this
repository's `grc-gate.yml` workflow, so a valid signature from any other repository or workflow is
rejected.

### Tamper Test

Signed evidence from [#7](https://github.com/m00t/grc-terraform-aws-bucket/pull/7), verified locally:

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Original bundle | ✅ `CHAIN INTACT` |
| One line appended to the bundle | ❌ `FAIL: INTEGRITY`: hash changed from `5fb4c035…` to `e3053ae0…` |
| One line appended **and** the `.sha256` sidecar rewritten to match | ❌ `FAIL: AUTHENTICITY`: the signature still binds the original hash (`5fb4c035…`), and only this repository's workflow can produce a new one |

The third test is the one that matters: a hash on its own can be regenerated by anyone, but the
signature cannot be forged without running as this repository's workflow, and that proof lives in
Sigstore, not in any account an attacker could compromise.
