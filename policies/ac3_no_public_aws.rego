# METADATA
# title: AC-3 - Access Enforcement (AWS S3 public access block)
# description: Every aws_s3_bucket must have a public access block with all four flags true.
# custom:
#   control_id: AC-3
#   framework: nist-800-53
#   severity: critical
#   remediation: Add aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block referencing the bucket, all four flags true.
